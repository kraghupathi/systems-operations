  - A snag repository is created on local git server.  The repository
    can be cloned using:
    #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    git clone http://<username>@git-server.virtual-labs.ac.in/git/snag
    #+END_EXAMPLE
    This snag repository contains proper sources for building ansible
    scripts and systems documentation.  The separate repository is
    created locally instead of using bitbucket/github to protect
    against accidental checking in of
    - passwords
    - keys
    - AWS access ID and secret tokens
