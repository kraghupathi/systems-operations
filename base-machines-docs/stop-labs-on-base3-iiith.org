Based on the documentation and requirement of labs-on-base2.org (vlead@vlead-desktop:~/vlead/projects/cleaning-deploy), we are going to stop containers running on IIITH. This is because, 
these containers are running on Amazon Web Services as well as IIITH servers.

We have labs hosted on Amazon Web Services (Open-Edx) as well as on IIITH (Base3). It is advised to stop the containers hosted on IIITH for the following labs that are avaiLable and 
running on Amazon Web Services (AWS) as well as IIITH servers.

Steps to stop containers hosted on IIITH (Base3)

1. Login to Base3 as follows:
   ssh username@XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX where XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX is the IP ADDR of Base3

2. Enter password

3. Enter the following command to see the list of all containers that are activa as well as not active:

   [root@base3 ~]# vlist -a

4. To get the CTID for all labs that are available and running on both servers, enter the following command:

   [root@base3 ~]# vlist -a | grep <hostname>, where hostname is the high level qualifier of the lab. For example, the hostname of http://cse04-iiith.virtual-labs.ac.in/ is cse04-iiith.

5. After getting a comprehensive list for all the duplicate labs, we can stop all the containers as follows:

   [root@base3 ~]# for i in {CT ID1 - CT IDn};do vzctl stop $i;done
