#+Title: Backups of important container configuration files
#+Author: Systems Team

* Introduction
  Version control all important configuration files that there in
  base3( currently ) machine. 


  Add important container configuration files into "backups" directory
  with proper container name( example: ldap.vlabs.ac.in,
  http.vlabs.ac.in,etc). 

  - NOTE :: Need to update these files at least once in a month. So
            that, even if you loose regular backup on physical
            machine( rsnapshot)( worst case), we can get backup from
            the backups that are version controled
