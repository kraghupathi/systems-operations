** Description:
+ The network is divided into public and private components
+ The public component is the *Router* and the *Ansible* which is
  exposed to the external network. We have two IP's exposed to
  external network.
+ The private component is the *Nagios*, *Reverse Proxy*, *DNS*,
  *Hosted Labs* and the *ADS service*.
+ Nagios is used to monitor and provide alert services for servers,
  applications, and services. It is used to alert the users when
  things go wrong and as well when the problem is been resolved.
+ Reverse Proxy will maintain a internal DNS to map the requests to
  the individual labs
+ All servers and service tasks like DNS, ADS are automated
  using Ansible
+ Ansible will take a request for configuration change and perofrm the
  house keeping
+ There will be only one user access allowed on Ansible
+ Labs will deployed using the ADS service 


** Security: 
Security will be provided by the following:
+ There will be one security group on Ansible
+ Firewall rules in iptables
