| [2018-08-07 Tue] | Rebooted the machine    | Thirumal &  | [[./img/reboot-err-msg.jpeg][Error]] repairing /dev/sda1. |   |
|                  |                         | Raghupathi  |                            |   |

| [2018-08-08 Wed] | Repaired the filesystem | Thirumal &  |                            |   |
|                  |                         | Raghupathi  |                            |   |

| [2018-08-08 Wed] | Mounted the partitions  | Thirumal,   |                            |   |
|                  |                         | Medamsh     |                            |   |

* Errors
  There was =Read-only file system= error ans was reported
  by Venkatesh when he tried to create a directory on
  =pascal= when he was trying to push his course material.

  Later in the day Raghupathi encountered the same error
  when trying to create a file on ldap container. 

  The [[./img/var-log-msgs.jpeg][logs]] report =EXT3-fs= error on the partition
  /dev/sdb1.  =/dev/sdb1= is mounted on =/mnt/das1=.

  Refer the [[./img/base-file-system.jpeg][file system]] on base3 machine.

* Action
  1. The machine was rebooted.  It took a long time and
     tried repairing the =/dev/sda1=.  After the repair, the
     login prompt was given with this [[./img/reboot-err-msg.jpeg][error]].  The error says
     that is an unexpected inconsistency and suggests to run
     =fsck= manually to correct this.

  2. =fsck -y -C /dev/sda1= is run to repair the
     =/dev/sda1=.  The repair went fine. 

  3. The machine is rebooted.  Only 
     =/dev/sdb3       1.9T  1.5T  305G  84% /mnt/das2= is
     mounted.  

     =/mnt/san1= and =/mnt/das3= are mounted manually.
     #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
     mkdir /mnt/san1
     mount /dev/sdc1 /mnt/san1

          
     mkdir /mnt/das3
     mount /dev/sda1 /mnt/das3/
     #+END_EXAMPLE

  4. Current file system (=df -h=)

     |------------+------+------+-------+------+-----------+---------------|
     | Filesystem | Size | Used | Avail | Use% | Mounted   | Purpose       |
     |            |      |      |       |      | on        |               |
     |------------+------+------+-------+------+-----------+---------------|
     | /dev/sdb1  | 49G  | 25G  | 21G   |  55% | /         | OS            |
     |------------+------+------+-------+------+-----------+---------------|
     | tmpfs      | 16G  | 72K  | 16G   |   1% | /dev/shm  |               |
     |------------+------+------+-------+------+-----------+---------------|
     | /dev/sdc1  | 1.9T | 1.1T | 717G  |  61% | /mnt/san1 | daily backups |
     |------------+------+------+-------+------+-----------+---------------|
     | /dev/sda1  | 1.7T | 1.2T | 387G  |  76% | /mnt/das3 | Containers    |
     |------------+------+------+-------+------+-----------+---------------|
     | /dev/sdb3  | 1.9T | 1.5T | 305G  |  84% | /mnt/das2 | earlier base3 |
     |            |      |      |       |      |           | backups       |
     |------------+------+------+-------+------+-----------+---------------|

  5. Start the containers
     1. Created a symbolic link to =/vz= pointing to
        =/mnt/das3/openvz_files=.

     2. Restarted the containers.
        #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
        for VE in $(vzlist -Ha -o veid); do vzctl start $VE; done
        #+END_EXAMPLE

     3. Start specific services on the containers
        1. =httpd= service is started on =12159= which is
           reverse proxy.
           #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
           service httpd restart
           #+END_EXAMPLE

        2. =named= service is started on =12161= which is
           public DNS.
           #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
           service named restart
           #+END_EXAMPLE
        3. =httpd= service is started on =12165= which is
           pascal
           #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
           service httpd restart
           #+END_EXAMPLE
